The phenomenon of wild animals being neglected has been a problem in big cities for a long time. People in cities tend to be individualistic, focused on things that are financially rewarding, and cut off from nature, plants, and animals. They may ignore or get rid of anything they deem useless or detrimental to their interests. Even so, that doesn't mean everyone doesn't care about wild animals that aren't taken care of. However, they don't know what to do, they don't know how to deal with animals that are not taken care of without disturbing their activities. From these problems, we are motivated to create an app that can connect users with animal husbandry as experts in this matter. This App allows users to give animals that they cannot care for to shelters or adopt pets. We hope this app can effectively reduce the number of abandoned animals and make the ecosystem better. This application uses a machine learning model, which is a recommendation system to provide recommendations for the name of the closest shelter based on the user's address and the type of animal to be adopted. This application also uses a camera feature that can detect types of cats and dogs.
