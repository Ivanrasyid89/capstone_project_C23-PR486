# Machine Learning

The Machine Learning team is tasked with finding datasets, namely shelter data and user data. In addition, he is in charge of making a recommendation system model and detecting animal species. The data obtained is very large and varied in order to obtain results with high accuracy values and accurate recommendations to users.

# Week 1
In the first week, the Machine Learning Team made preparations and searched for various datasets that would be used to train and test the model.
